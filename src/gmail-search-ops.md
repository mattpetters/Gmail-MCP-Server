**Tips:**
*   You can combine multiple operators to narrow down your search.
*   For dates, `YYYY/MM/DD` is a common format.
*   When using numbers, a space or a dash (`-`) separates them, while a dot (`.`) acts as a decimal.
*   `AND` is usually implied when you use multiple terms, but you can use it explicitly for clarity.
